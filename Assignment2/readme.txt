  - different_stiffness.mp4: demo of the hanging mesh with k_bend and k_stretch
							 values of .2, .5, and .8.
  - collisions.mp4: demo of two spheres bumping into one another with collisions.s
  - dragging_sphere.mp4: demo of particle dragging on a inflated sphere.
  - self_collisions.mp4: demo of self collisions with piece of cloth.
  - stiff_sliders.mp4: demo of the k-value sliders used while simulation.
					   First k_stretch is altered, followed by k_bend.
  
Summary:

We implemented the position-based dynamic simulator, using the formulas given in
class and in the paper "Position Based Dynamics" by MÃ¼ller, Heidelberger, et al. The core
simulator follows the timestepping scheme given in the paper.


As extensions, we implemented both self-collisions as described in section 4.3 in the paper.
This was further expanded to allow collisions between objects.
Additionally, we added simple interactive k-value sliders that allow the user to alter the value
of k-bend and k-stretch during the simulation.

Findings:

We found that extreme values of the stiffness values -- near 0 or near 1 -- were not
suitable for realistic cloth simulations. We also found that it is difficult to eliminate
jitter when resolving cloth collisions, and we do occasionally have some problems when
the cloth folds over on itself in the wrong way.

Collaborators:

We discussed some techniques for picking and dragging particles with Daniel Levine.

Citations:

Aside from the paper "Position Based Dynamics", the sources for any algorithms that we
did not come up with ourselves are commented in the code.
