Videos (in videos/ directory):

  - different_stiffness.mp4: demo of the hanging mesh with k_bend and k_stretch
							 values of .2, .5, and .8.
  - collisions.mp4: demo of two spheres bumping into one another with collisions.s
  - dragging_sphere.mp4: demo of particle dragging on a inflated sphere.
  - self_collisions.mp4: demo of self collisions with piece of cloth.
  - stiff_sliders.mp4: demo of the k-value sliders used while simulation.
					   First k_stretch is altered, followed by k_bend.
  
Summary:

We implemented the position-based dynamic simulator, using the formulas given in
class and in the paper "Position Based Dynamics" by MÃ¼ller, Heidelberger, et al. The core
simulator follows the timestepping scheme given in the paper.


As extensions, we implemented both self-collisions as described in section 4.3 in the paper.
This was further expanded to allow collisions between objects.
Additionally, we added simple interactive k-value sliders that allow the user to alter the value
of k-bend and k-stretch during the simulation.
