Here, we propose a project focused on the implementation of dynamic
fracture simulations, as detailed in \cite{Mul13}. The method
described is an improvement on previous methods for fracture
simulations, which typically involve using pre-fractured models and
replacing objects with these fragments at runtime. These older methods
have the disadvantage that fracture patterns generally do not match
the impact location. The newer method uses volumetric approximate
convex decompositions (VACDs), whereby pre-defined fracture patterns
are applied to the pieces of geometry, and the geometry is
subsequently split into a non-overlapping convex cover of itself.  The
method described in \cite{Mul13} is quite detailed, and we plan to
first handle the simpler task of implementing it in two dimensions,
before possibly adapting our implementation (time-permitting) to three
dimensions.

\section{Introduction}

Simulations of fracturing objects are becoming increasingly applicable
and desirable in media such as movies and games, where, depending on
the genre, scenes of massive and wanton destruction may be
commonplace. Particularly in the context of video games, the prospect
of every rigid object being indestructible may be perceived as
implausible by an observer. While pre-fracturing is an option for
interactive simulations, this requires additional work for every
breakable asset, and prevents the pattern of fracture from depending
on the point of impact. There are also various other drawbacks, such
as pieces of objects being unable to break further without
preemptively preparing multiple levels of pre-fracturing.

A dynamic fracture simulation could potentially save time in producing
these assets, in addition to providing additional realism by allowing
objects to fracture in different ways, depending on the direction and
location of impact. In \cite{Mul13}, M\"uller et al. present a new
method for such dynamic fractures, which simultaneously preserves
interactive speeds.

\section{Related Work}

The primary paper we will be focusing on is M\"uller et
al. \cite{Mul13} where the methods and algorithms for dynamic fracture
simulation are presented. Before this paper, various other methods for
fracture simulation had been described, dating back as early as
Terzopoulos et al. \cite{Ter88} and Norton et al. \cite{Nor91}, the
latter making use of a mass-spring model. O'Brien et al. \cite{Obr99}
presented a method that used continuum mechanics to compute internal
stresses and fracture directions.

Parker et al. \cite{Par09} proposed a method for fracture simulation
that used a relatively coarse tetrahedral mesh, where objects can
fracture only along the bounaries of the tetrahedra; in order to hide
the coarseness of the mesh, they also introduce ``splinters''
associated with each element. This method is primarily targeted at
computer games, as it runs at interactive speeds.

Pre-fracturing objects is a commonly-used approach in movies and
games, as mentioned, and a wide array of methods for breaking up
objects has been proposed. A few of the many techniques include manual
cutting by artists, image guidance \cite{Mou05}, Voronoi fracturing of
surfaces \cite{Rag02}, and tetrahedralization \cite{Par09}.

\section{Technical Description}

The method described only works with meshes that satisfy the following
three properties: (1) the meshes are composed of convex pieces, (2)
the pieces do not overlap, and (3) any two pieces are physically
connected if and only if the first piece has at least one face that
partially or fully overlaps one face of the second piece, and the two
faces are coplanar with opposite normals. A mesh satisfying this is
called a compound. Note that meshes created by volumetric approximate
convex decomposition satisfy this property by default; the exact
algorithm for performing the VACD is given in the paper.

The method uses fracture patterns, which are partitions of the entire
space into convex pieces. Once fracturing is called for, the following
steps are performed. The fracture pattern is first translated to align
with the impact location. We then compute all intersections of all
cells of the fracture pattern with all convex pieces of the
object. Next, in order to save computation time, we find all pieces
that are completely covered with newly created convexes, and replace
these all with a single convex with the same shape. All convexes
within the same cell are then combined to form a new
compound. Finally, we check for disconnected ``islands'' of convexes
that have been grouped into the same mesh, and turn them into separate
compounds.

\section{Proposal and Expectations}



\section{Extensions, time-permitting}

Depending on our timing, there are a couple extensions we would implement. First
would be an acceleration structure such as a k-d tree to expedite collision handling.
Next, we would like to incorporate a more thorough rendering platform using Blinn-phong
shaders and texture mapping. Lastly, we will attempt to move our system into 3D (although
highly unlikely).
